# Question 1
What will the following code print and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```python
num = 5

def my_func():
    print(num)

my_func()
```

## My solution
It will print 5 when the function is invoked because it is reading/accessing the value of the num variable that is in the global scope.
