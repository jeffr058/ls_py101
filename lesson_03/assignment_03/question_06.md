# Question 6
Back in the stone age (before CSS), we used spaces to align things on the screen. If we have a 40-character wide table of Flintstone family members, how can we center the following title above the table with spaces?


```python
title = "Flintstone Family Members"
```

## My solution
```python
title.center(40)
```
