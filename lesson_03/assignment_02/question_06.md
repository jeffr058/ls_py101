# Question 6
Determine whether the name Dino appears in the strings below -- check each string separately:

```python
str1 = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
str2 = "Fred and Wilma have a pet dinosaur named Dino."
```

## My solution
```python
print('Dino' in str1)
print('Dino' in str2)
```
