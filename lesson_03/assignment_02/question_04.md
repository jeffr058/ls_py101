# Question 4
Using the following string, print a string that contains the same value, but using all lowercase letters except for the first character, which should be capitalized.

```python
munsters_description = "the Munsters are CREEPY and Spooky."
# => 'The munsters are creepy and spooky.'
```

## My solution
```python
print(munsters_description.capitalize())
```
