# Question 4
What will the following two lines of code output?


```python
print(0.3 + 0.6)
print(0.3 + 0.6 == 0.9)
```
What will the following two lines of code output?


## My solution
```python
The first line will output 0.9.  # Correction: outputs 0.8999999999999999
The second line will output False because decimal fractions often cannot be represented precisely in binary (base-2), which is how computers store numbers.
```
